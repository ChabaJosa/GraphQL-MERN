## GraphQL Full-Stack App

IF you already have nodeJS installed and have cloned this repo already,<br/>
in the project directory, follow these instructions:

### Step 1: Create config.js file

Create a config.js file that looks like the sample-config.js file<br />
The secret key can be any string.


### Step 2: Open terminals and start backend

Open 2 separate terminal windows from the project directory.<br />
In 1 of the 2 terminals, run `npm i`<br />
and then once you have the node modules, run `npm run serve`<br />

### Step 3: Start Frontend

In the other terminal, run `cd frontend`<br />
Once in the frontend directory run `npm i` <br />
and then once you have the node modules run `npm start`


### Note: It's important that you start the server first :)


### That's it!
